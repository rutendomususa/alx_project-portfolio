	<h2>About EduConnect</h2>
  		<p>
		  The idea for EduConnect was born from a belief in the power of education to transform lives. Growing up, I witnessed the challenges faced by students in underserved communities. Limited access to quality learning resources created a significant education gapâ€”one I had passion to address.  
		</p>
		<p>
		   I set out to create a platform that bridges this gap through digital learning. What started as an ambitious idea quickly evolved into EduConnect, a platform designed to provide easy access to courses, track progress, and enable educators to share knowledge efficiently.
		</p>
		<p>
		  The development of EduConnect was not just a technical challenge but a personal journey. Over the course of this Portfolio Project for <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/" target="_blank">ALX</a>, I have learned not only to collaborate effectively but also to empathize with the real needs of students and educators.
